    description2: "I have completed a bootcamp at Hactive8, where I learned Fullstack Web Development. A project I worked on towards the end of my studies sparked my interest in web development. The project was focused on creating a website related to movies on historical themes, which could serve as an educational tool. While the website wasnâ€™t the primary focus, working on it gave me the thrill and realization that web development is the right path for me. I am passionate about continuously learning and exploring all programming languages to expand my knowledge and skills.",
